## Module #3 - Get Your Mind Right (Required)

As every successful person will tell you: *Attitude is everything*. 

For this reason, as you embark on the challenging endeavor that is this Coding Bootcamp, it's imperative that you align your attitudes and expectations with the realites to come. 

Don't underestimate the amount of mental and emotional discipline this Bootcamp will require. Take the time to prepare yourself by reading through the following tips and suggestions. 

(p.s. Don't breeze through these! They are *important*!)

### Top 10 Keys to Success

### 1. A Little Humility Never Hurt Nobody...

Whether you believe it or not -- this bootcamp will be one of the most challenging learning experiences of your life. For most of you, the skills being taught in the program will be fundamentally different from any you've been exposed to before. In fact, your past skills, schooling, and experiences are unlikely to help you become a succesful developer. Instead, in order to succeed, you will need to channel your inner toddler -- and learn to "*learn*" again. 

This will be a *very* challenging identity for many of you. If you've had past academic or career successes in another trade or industry -- you may find yourself resisting the idea that you can *"fail"* so dramatically at coding. 

Yet, heed this advice now: *"A humble learner is the most ready learner."* Take each class as a new opportunity to be proven a fool and learn anew. Six months from now, you will marvel at the mastery you gained.

### 2. There is No Coding Pill...

The greatest self-lie you can tell is that any program will *teach* you to code. Instead, it's important to realize that, in order to succeed, *YOU* must own your learning experience. 

Coding, like any craft, requires diligent effort, constant experimentation, and a relentless desire to self-improve. These characteristics cannot be taught in any classroom.  From Day 1 through Day 180 and beyond, remind yourself that *YOU* are responsible for your ultimate success. We will be here to guide, encourage, facilitate, point out your mistakes, and show you the path -- but it's up to you to put in the effort.

Don't get discouraged! We know you can do it. 

### 3. Put in the Hard Hours (at least 20 hours...)

According to the author Malcolm Gladwell, successful people put in a minimum of 10,000 hours of deliberate effort to master their craft. Thus, as newcomers to the field of web development, be ready to put in your share of hours. 

While the bare minimum to "survive" this program is 10 hours of outside class time, we've consistently found that those most successful put in closer to 20 hours of outside effort per week. At times, this number might even need to go upwards of 30 or 40 hours per week week during more challenging topics.  

Simply said, there is no substitute for these long, hard hours. 

Consider this time to be an investment in yourself, and know that for every hour you spend -- you are guaranteeing yourself a better opportunity upon graduation. 

### 4. Patience Makes Perfect...

Tied to the previous suggestion about time is a second piece often forgotten. Not only will learning to code require many hours -- it will also require many months (and frankly years) to master. Don't rush success! 

For almost all of you, the first few few month of the program will be particularly challenging. In fact, for many of you, this period will be one in which you doubt your eventual success through the program. Resist the urge to give in or get hopeless!

Realize that learning this craft will require consistent effort that will iteratively build your skills and understanding. What will seem challenging, confusing, and distressing in Week 3 -- will seem completely second nature by Week 24. *Intensity is no substitute for consistency.*

### 5. Crumple the Paper Tiger...

*"Am I doing this right...?"* The five most hated words of every development instructor.

These words aren't hated because your instructor is unwilling or unable to help. Rather, they're hated, because they suggest a student is afraid to *try* something on their own. As you enter the clasroom, learn to abolish this phrase from your vocabulary now. 

Instead, try things on your own, test what you can, and do a bit of debugging first. *Then*, instead of timidly asking for assurance -- turn to your instructor and say: *"I tried such and such. It didn't work. So I tried such and such. But it still didn't work. What should I try now?* 

Notice, the change in tone. Instead of asking for permission, remind yourself to "just try". The best way to fail is on your own terms. 

### 6. Find a Squad...

For whatever reason, Hollywood has created a conception that every coder is an isolated loner -- programming in a cubicle. Don't let this be you!

While in this program, make every effort to find friends, form study groups, and work together in and out of class. Sometimes, the fastest way to overcome a bug or understand a challenging concept is to have another pair of eyes or another perspective. Pair programming is a real thing for a reason!

### 7. Master The Art of Google Fu...

One of the greatest surprises to students entering the program is the amount of "Googling" they are asked to do. This isn't because your teacher is lazy or the curriculum is unplanned. Far from it! 

As every professional developer will tell you -- coding isn't about "memorization". Instead, it's about curating bits and pieces of knowledge, scattered across the web and accumulated in various documentation, forums, and QA websites.  

To become a good developer requires an ability to work through problems and quickly "research" solutions ascertained by past developers. The field is constantly changing and new tools are always on the horizon. As you will find, every good developer is a great friend of Google (and Stack Overflow...).

### 8. Fixing Things Takes Time....

One of the most frustrating aspects to new students of software development is the sheer amount of time it takes to troubleshoot (or *debug*) issues in code. At time, it might even feel like "fixing" an issue is taking 3-4 times as long as conceiving the original solution.  

*Know in advance, that this is completely normal.*

For novices and experts alike, fixing code is often the most time-consuming task of all. Instead, of seeing these hours spent as a "distraction" getting in the way, learn to see them as a critical part of the learning process. Each bug you pursue is a lengthy lesson that adds to your arsenal of understanding.

### 9. Plan Often...

As you will learn in the pseudocoding module, the best first step in *every* coding challenge is to first create a plan. Break down the complex task in front of you into discrete, bite-sized coding challenges. Once you have a plan, write it out and always refer back to it. 

Fundamentally, every task in code -- can and should be broken into smaller tasks. Don't try to bite off everything at once! You'll get lost in your own mindgames.

### 10. You Can Do This!

This last piece of advice is the most important. Remind yourself each day that you *can* do this. We've seen through many classrooms, students from all backgrounds, experiences, and personal situations persevere and succeed through this program. 

During the tough times, dig deep into your own personal motivation -- and remind yourself why you entered the program. Let this be the fuel that you use to keep on. 

You have *everything* it takes to learn this craft and gain the opportunities that come with it. It may feel challenging at times, but remind yourself of past challenges you've overcome. Your future self will thank you for all that you endured.
